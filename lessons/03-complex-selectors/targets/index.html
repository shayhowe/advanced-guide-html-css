        <h2>Why did the Saved By The Bell gang live in Indiana in junior high, and then turn up in the same school with only a different name and a few different characters in California?</h2>
        <p>There isn&rsquo;t a solid explanation for that except that Saved By The Bell went through a lot of changes between junior high and middle school, including its move from Disney to NBC.</p>

        <h2>Did the Saved By The Bell cast really sing those songs on the show and soundtrack? If not, who did sing them?</h2>
        <p>The Saved By The Bell cast did not sing those songs themselves, they were lip synching to audio recordings. I not quite sure who actually performed the songs in the show, nor do I know anyone who does. The actual singers are not credited on the show's credits or soundtrack.</p>

        <h2>While we&rsquo;re on the subject of Saved By The Bell music, what is that song they play at Zack and Kelly&rsquo;s wedding? Do you know the title or who sings it?</h2>
        <p>That is one of Saved By The Bells biggest mysteries, and by far the most frequently asked question. Unfortunately, I don't know the title of the song, nor do I have any clue who performed this song either. Like the other Saved By The Bell songs, it is not listed in the credits. I have searched and asked around and nobody, and I do mean nobody seems to know the answer to this question. And if somebody does, there not talking.</p>
